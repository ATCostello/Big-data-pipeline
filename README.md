# Big data pipeline
My part of a groupwork python project to create a big data pipeline on a google data cluster. Includes preprocessing, mapping and reducing of the data.
Data is not included as to not violate TOS.

The preprocessing stage omits outliers in the data via the use of interquartile range, replaces hash strings found with their corresponding cumbers, converts scientific notations to their float values, and generates a new column labelled "processID".
